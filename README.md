# The "Haunted" (if you're unscientific) Research Station

## 2024-04-09: Starting off
On Fellowship station, which is a place people go to in order to get credits to exchange for other things needed. 

Ulendra is on the station to socialize and gauge if there are any logistics computers that need to be repaired anywhere.

Bead is on the station to study botany in order to rebuild ecosystems on a devastated planet.

Znmvnm is looking for information to trade, irt an experiment that went awry.

--

Waiting in an open space, for a polite continuant to return who welcomed us in, and asked us to wait for updates on new tasks

Two other applicants arrive, and are having a heated, mumbling discussion that seems to be escalating. One is a bright blue Hmza, the other is a Thricix (insectoid, looks like an ant meets praying mantis). Their argument gets louder, and the

the Hmza: "we should go back, there's lots of valuable equipment there"

the Thricix: "we should just move on, find something else, I'm not interested in going back"

Znmvnm goops over and asks what they're talking about. Ulendra starts recording with nanobot network.

Thricix: "It's nothing, don't listen to my companion."

Hmza: "Lox, it's not an obsession, we were doing valuable work on the research station, and I think it's premature to abandon all the good work we were doing over there just because a couple of the staff got spooked. Our work is of great value to the scientific community."

Lox the Thricix does the bug equivalent of crossing arms.

The Hmza is definitely excited about this and intends on going back.

Znmvnm: "What are they all spooked about?"

Lox: "The station started acting strangely, like it had a mind of its own. I don't know the details, I wasn't part of Professor Brockson's main team. It was weird stuff, the air would shut off, the gravity, cargo would be shot off into space. It wasn't a great working environment. Some of the crew were thinking it was haunted."

Bead (in their head) : "I knew it"

Zmza, the Hmza: vibrating like a plate of jelly in scoff: "look, Professor Brockson, who is a great scientific mind, told the staff that he had made a tremendous find, that would revolutionize the union's understanding of The Tide, this weird energy that permeates everything that we're supposed to be researching. Seems a shame to leave that discovery to rot on the abandoned research station. We owe it to the scientific community to go back there."

Znmvn: "I think I've heard of Professor Brockson, he's an Ukeran, correct? I read a couple articles, but what are the specifics?"

Zmza: "Well, Professor Brockson kept things hush hush. He did make breakthroughs in Tide propulsion devices. As to this important discovery, he kept it close to his chest. I wasn't on his research team.

Znmvnm: "It sounds like you need som ekind of tech expert."

Ulendra: "What system are you running over there."

Znmza: "Well the Free Spirit station is equipped with the top of the line Crimson 5 system. I'm sure there's a perfectly rationaly explanation.

Bead (thinking): "Sounds like a damn ghost."

Lox: to Lendra "if you and your friend here want to go to the station and fix the computer, that's fine, I'm not going. Whatever Zmza is saying, hes' sticking with me. If you want to go, I can give the last known coordinates."


Zmza: looks at Lendra "Oh if you do go, and you find something, I hope you will come back and tell me about it."

Hands a memory device with the Free Spirit station coords and contact details.


The Continuant returns, and a door opens to the side. This Continuant has a big smile decalled onto her head, and says: "Well thank you all so much for waiting. I'm afraid it's a little early in the day, but we have one task that needs doing. I'll put up the details on the screen."

The screen has the following info:
"Min Crew of 3 for delivery of agricultural equipme,nt to Castrin (a grower asteroid), 600 Union credits, apply at 9am station time, cargo loading dock 12"


Zmza: "We're going to wait for the next task, but the last known coordinates are near the asteroid."

Bead: "That shit's haunted."

Lox: *squidward style laughing*: "Hah, ghosts"

Bead: "I've seen the effects of ghosts"

Lox: "If you want to go to the Free Spirit to look for ghosts, fine, I'm not going"

**the three of us accept the delivery, with the intent of maybe following up with the Free Spirit**

**we make our way to cargo loading dock 12, which is where Ulendra's ship is parked**

re: Ulendra's ship
    kept up, one sleeping quarters, 3 floflofs (furry squid cats)

**equipment gets loaded up**

Beads motivation is going toward this sector for the purpose of agriculture research and will be left off before going to what they assume is a haunted station. Grower asteroids are different examples of agriculture in space. Castrin might hold some info that holds information that might be helpful to Bead.

Bead takes the seat in the ship next to Ulendra, since it's a Ukeran ship.


We're on the way to Castrin for the delivery. We know the station is somewhere around here, but we proceed toward Castrin asteroid to drop goods off first.

We're traveling almost the whole day, in this space van. A beep comes from the cockpit, and I notice that this is a distress call, it's ringing

Ulendra answers the call, there's some static, and a voice says "Hello, can you hear me? Oh thank goodness, I'm stranded here in a civilian craft, just me and my boy, I don't think we're that far from you. We could use some help."

Ul: "what's the trouble?"

"Some weird beastie, hello hello, my name's Erik, what's your name?"

"We had a technical malfunction, but we have no power"


**They send their coordinates, we move the ship in their direction, and it's a civilian craft, enough for 2 people. Through the window, we can see an adult and child Thricix, both look a bit like ladybugs, the little one is fluttering all over the place.**

Erik: "But what if the beastie comes back and gets their car as well!"
