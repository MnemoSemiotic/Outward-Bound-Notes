## 2024-04-09: Starting off
On Fellowship station, which is a place people go to in order to get credits to exchange for other things needed. 

Ulendra is on the station to socialize and gauge if there are any logistics computers that need to be repaired anywhere.

Bead is on the station to study botany in order to rebuild ecosystems on a devastated planet.

Znmvnm is looking for information to trade, irt an experiment that went awry.

Waiting in an open space, for a polite continuant to return who welcomed us in, and asked us to wait for updates on new tasks

Two other applicants arrive, and are having a heated, mumbling discussion that seems to be escalating. One is a bright blue Hmza, the other is a Thricix (insectoid, looks like an ant meets praying mantis). Their argument gets louder, and the

the Hmza: "we should go back, there's lots of valuable equipment there"

the Thricix: "we should just move on, find something else, I'm not interested in going back"

Znmvnm goops over and asks what they're talking about. Ulendra starts recording with nanobot network.

Thricix: "It's nothing, don't listen to my companion."

Hmza: "Lox, it's not an obsession, we were doing valuable work on the research station, and I think it's premature to abandon all the good work we were doing over there just because a couple of the staff got spooked. Our work is of great value to the scientific community."

Lox the Thricix does the bug equivalent of crossing arms.

The Hmza is definitely excited about this and intends on going back.

Znmvnm: "What are they all spooked about?"

Lox: "The station started acting strangely, like it had a mind of its own. I don't know the details, I wasn't part of Professor Brockson's main team. It was weird stuff, the air would shut off, the gravity, cargo would be shot off into space. It wasn't a great working environment. Some of the crew were thinking it was haunted."

Bead (in their head) : "I knew it"
