#### Simple Python Dice Roller

```python
from random import choice
def roll_dice(n=1, sides=6): 
    return sum([choice(range(1,sides+1)) for _ in range(n)])
```


## 2024-04-09: Starting off
On Fellowship station, which is a place people go to in order to get credits to exchange for other things needed. 

Ulendra is on the station to socialize and gauge if there are any logistics computers that need to be repaired anywhere.

Bead is on the station to study botany in order to rebuild ecosystems on a devastated planet.

Znmvnm is looking for information to trade, irt an experiment that went awry.

--

Waiting in an open space, for a polite continuant to return who welcomed us in, and asked us to wait for updates on new tasks

Two other applicants arrive, and are having a heated, mumbling discussion that seems to be escalating. One is a bright blue Hmza, the other is a Thricix (insectoid, looks like an ant meets praying mantis). Their argument gets louder, and the

the Hmza: "we should go back, there's lots of valuable equipment there"

the Thricix: "we should just move on, find something else, I'm not interested in going back"

Znmvnm goops over and asks what they're talking about. Ulendra starts recording with nanobot network.

Thricix: "It's nothing, don't listen to my companion."

Hmza: "Lox, it's not an obsession, we were doing valuable work on the research station, and I think it's premature to abandon all the good work we were doing over there just because a couple of the staff got spooked. Our work is of great value to the scientific community."

Lox the Thricix does the bug equivalent of crossing arms.

The Hmza is definitely excited about this and intends on going back.

Znmvnm: "What are they all spooked about?"

Lox: "The station started acting strangely, like it had a mind of its own. I don't know the details, I wasn't part of Professor Brockson's main team. It was weird stuff, the air would shut off, the gravity, cargo would be shot off into space. It wasn't a great working environment. Some of the crew were thinking it was haunted."

Bead (in their head) : "I knew it"

Zmza, the Hmza: vibrating like a plate of jelly in scoff: "look, Professor Brockson, who is a great scientific mind, told the staff that he had made a tremendous find, that would revolutionize the union's understanding of The Tide, this weird energy that permeates everything that we're supposed to be researching. Seems a shame to leave that discovery to rot on the abandoned research station. We owe it to the scientific community to go back there."

Znmvn: "I think I've heard of Professor Brockson, he's an Ukeran, correct? I read a couple articles, but what are the specifics?"

Zmza: "Well, Professor Brockson kept things hush hush. He did make breakthroughs in Tide propulsion devices. As to this important discovery, he kept it close to his chest. I wasn't on his research team.

Znmvnm: "It sounds like you need som ekind of tech expert."

Ulendra: "What system are you running over there."

Znmza: "Well the Free Spirit station is equipped with the top of the line Crimson 5 system. I'm sure there's a perfectly rationaly explanation.

Bead (thinking): "Sounds like a damn ghost."

Lox: to Lendra "if you and your friend here want to go to the station and fix the computer, that's fine, I'm not going. Whatever Zmza is saying, hes' sticking with me. If you want to go, I can give the last known coordinates."


Zmza: looks at Lendra "Oh if you do go, and you find something, I hope you will come back and tell me about it."

Hands a memory device with the Free Spirit station coords and contact details.


The Continuant returns, and a door opens to the side. This Continuant has a big smile decalled onto her head, and says: "Well thank you all so much for waiting. I'm afraid it's a little early in the day, but we have one task that needs doing. I'll put up the details on the screen."

The screen has the following info:
"Min Crew of 3 for delivery of agricultural equipme,nt to Castrin (a grower asteroid), 600 Union credits, apply at 9am station time, cargo loading dock 12"
